Really nice iOS tutorial showing RESTKit + Foursquare

1. Just a simple list
2. list + distance of the coffeehouses
3. final is list of coffeehouses in a given area + checkins and distance from the apple office location



Here is list of what you have done:
- An introduction to UITableView using the Master-Detail Application template.
- RestKit installation and configuration for your app.
- Foursquare configuration for your app and an introduction to their Venues API.
- Created data models for your app.
- Setup RestKit mappings so that it can request, receive and parse the data into your data model.
- Created a custom table view cell to display the Foursquare data.

Here is what you did not do:
- Setup and use NSURLConnections or NSURLConnectionDelegates.
- Parse JSON or XML data.
- Map the JSON or XML responses to your own objects.

From here, feel free set up Foursquare user authentication to gain full access to Foursquareâ€™s API and extend this example with even more features, or find other web services that you can use RestKit to provide data for your app.
